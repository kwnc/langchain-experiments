       "\"Languagem is a fantastic tool for language learners, and it can also be quite helpful in testing. Here are some ways Langsmith can assist:\\n\\n1. **Error detection**: Langsmith's AI-powered algorithms can analyze text written by learners and identify grammatical errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This helps teachers and tutors to pinpoint areas where students need improvement.\\n2. **Grammar and syntax checks**: Langsmith's grammar rules and linguistic patterns can be used to test whether learner-generated texts conform to the target language's rules and conventions. This is particularly useful for testing sentence structure, verb tenses, and other grammatical aspects.\\n3. **Vocabulary assessment**: Langsmith can help evaluate learners' vocabulary by analyzing their text-based responses and identifying unfamiliar or misused words. This feedback enables teachers to focus on teaching specific vocabulary items.\\n4. **Readability and comprehension checks**: Langsmith's readability metrics can assess the clarity and coherence of learner-generated texts, helping teachers identify areas where students may need additional practice or support.\\n5. **Automated grading**: By integrating Langsmith's evaluation tools with your existing testing systems, you can create automated grading systems that provide instant feedback to learners.\\n\\nTo get started, you can use Langsmith's API (Application Programming Interface) to connect it to your testing platform. This allows you to leverage Langsmith's capabilities for text analysis and evaluation within your own system.\\n\\nDo you have any specific testing requirements or scenarios where you think Langsmith could be particularly helpful?

Here\\'s how it works:\\n\\nWhen you\\'re working on a project in Langsmith, you might encounter a situation where you need to add new information or modify existing data to improve the accuracy and quality of your dataset. That\\'s where \\'Add to Dataset\\' comes into play.\\n\\nThis feature allows you to seamlessly integrate new data into an existing dataset, ensuring that all relevant information is preserved and organized in a single location. You can think of it as a \"dataset aggregator\" or a \"data merger.\"\\n\\nTo utilize this functionality, follow these general steps:\\n\\n1. Open the project containing the dataset you want to update.\\n2. Navigate to the specific dataset file or folder where your data resides.\\n3. Right-click on the dataset and select \\'Add to Dataset\\' from the context menu.\\n\\nAt this point, Langsmith will prompt you to choose the type of data you want to add (e.g., text, images, audio). You can then upload the new data, and Langsmith\\'s algorithms will automatically merge it with your existing dataset. The platform might even use machine learning models to identify patterns, classify data, or perform other annotation tasks, depending on the nature of your project.\\n\\nBy leveraging \\'Add to Dataset,\\' you can maintain a single, cohesive view of your data across various sources, making it easier to analyze and draw meaningful insights from your findings. This feature streamlines the process of managing complex datasets, allowing you to focus on higher-level tasks like data-driven decision-making or further analysis.\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve demystified Langsmith\\'s \\'Add to Dataset\\' functionality for you, feel free to ask any follow-up questions or explore more advanced topics in Langsmith!'"

       " Document(page_content=\"Every playground run is logged in the system and can be used to create test cases or compare with other runs.Beta Testing\\u200bBeta testing allows developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. In this phase, it’s important to develop an understanding for the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly it’s breaking down in those cases. Both feedback collection and run annotation are critical for this workflow. This will help in curation of test cases that can help track regressions/improvements and development of automatic evaluations.Capturing Feedback\\u200bWhen launching your application to an initial set of users, it’s important to gather human feedback on the responses it’s producing. This helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses. LangSmith allows you to attach feedback scores to logged traces (oftentimes, this is hooked up to a feedback button in your app), then filter on traces that have a specific feedback tag and score. A common workflow is to filter on traces that receive a poor user feedback score, then drill down into problematic points using the detailed trace view.Annotating Traces\\u200bLangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, which allow annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. Annotators can be PMs, engineers, or even subject matter experts. This allows users to catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.Adding Runs to a Dataset\\u200bAs your application progresses through the beta testing phase, it's essential to continue collecting data to refine and improve its performance. LangSmith enables you to add runs as examples to datasets (from both the project page and within an annotation queue), expanding your test coverage on real-world scenarios. This is a key benefit in having your logging system and your evaluation/testing system in the same platform.Production\\u200bClosely inspecting key data points, growing benchmarking datasets, annotating traces, and drilling down into important data in trace view are workflows you’ll also want to do once your app hits production.However, especially at the production stage, it’s crucial to get a high-level overview of application performance with respect to latency, cost, and feedback scores. This ensures that it's delivering desirable results at scale.Online evaluations and automations allow you to process and score production traces in near real-time.Additionally, threads provide a seamless way to group traces from a single conversation, making it easier to track the performance of your application across multiple turns.Monitoring and A/B Testing\\u200bLangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow you to track key metrics over time. You can expand to view metrics for a given period and drill down into a specific data point to get a trace table for that time period — this is especially handy for debugging production issues.LangSmith also allows for tag and metadata grouping, which allows users to mark different versions of their applications with different identifiers and view how they are performing side-by-side within each chart. This is helpful for A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.Automations\\u200bAutomations are a powerful feature in LangSmith that allow you to perform actions on traces in near real-time. This can be used to automatically score traces, send them to annotation queues, or send them to datasets.To define an automation, simply provide a filter condition, a sampling rate, and an action to perform. Automations are particularly helpful for processing traces at production scale.Threads\\u200bMany LLM applications are multi-turn, meaning that they involve a series of interactions between the user and the application.

       "  Document(page_content=\"Every playground run is logged in the system and can be used to create test cases or compare with other runs.Beta Testing\\u200bBeta testing allows developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. In this phase, it’s important to develop an understanding for the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly it’s breaking down in those cases. Both feedback collection and run annotation are critical for this workflow. This will help in curation of test cases that can help track regressions/improvements and development of automatic evaluations.Capturing Feedback\\u200bWhen launching your application to an initial set of users, it’s important to gather human feedback on the responses it’s producing. This helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses. LangSmith allows you to attach feedback scores to logged traces (oftentimes, this is hooked up to a feedback button in your app), then filter on traces that have a specific feedback tag and score. A common workflow is to filter on traces that receive a poor user feedback score, then drill down into problematic points using the detailed trace view.Annotating Traces\\u200bLangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, which allow annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. Annotators can be PMs, engineers, or even subject matter experts. This allows users to catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.Adding Runs to a Dataset\\u200bAs your application progresses through the beta testing phase, it's essential to continue collecting data to refine and improve its performance. LangSmith enables you to add runs as examples to datasets (from both the project page and within an annotation queue), expanding your test coverage on real-world scenarios. This is a key benefit in having your logging system and your evaluation/testing system in the same platform.Production\\u200bClosely inspecting key data points, growing benchmarking datasets, annotating traces, and drilling down into important data in trace view are workflows you’ll also want to do once your app hits production.However, especially at the production stage, it’s crucial to get a high-level overview of application performance with respect to latency, cost, and feedback scores. This ensures that it's delivering desirable results at scale.Online evaluations and automations allow you to process and score production traces in near real-time.Additionally, threads provide a seamless way to group traces from a single conversation, making it easier to track the performance of your application across multiple turns.Monitoring and A/B Testing\\u200bLangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow you to track key metrics over time. You can expand to view metrics for a given period and drill down into a specific data point to get a trace table for that time period — this is especially handy for debugging production issues.LangSmith also allows for tag and metadata grouping, which allows users to mark different versions of their applications with different identifiers and view how they are performing side-by-side within each chart. This is helpful for A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.Automations\\u200bAutomations are a powerful feature in LangSmith that allow you to perform actions on traces in near real-time. This can be used to automatically score traces, send them to annotation queues, or send them to datasets.To define an automation, simply provide a filter condition, a sampling rate, and an action to perform. Automations are particularly helpful for processing traces at production scale.Threads\\u200bMany LLM applications are multi-turn, meaning that they involve a series of interactions between the user and the application. LangSmith provides a threads view that groups traces from a single conversation together, making it easier to\", metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/user_guide', 'title': 'LangSmith User Guide | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith', 'description': 'LangSmith is a platform for LLM application development, monitoring, and testing.

       " 'answer': \"LangSmith can indeed help you test your LLM applications.\\n\\nDuring the prototyping phase, LangSmith provides a playground environment for rapid iteration and experimentation. This allows you to quickly test out different prompts and models. You can open the playground from any prompt or model run in your trace. Every playground run is logged in the system and can be used to create test cases or compare with other runs.\\n\\nWhen developing new LLM applications, Langsmith suggests having tracing enabled by default. Oftentimes, it isn't necessary to look at every single trace. However, when things go wrong (an unexpected end result, infinite agent loop, slower than expected execution, higher than expected token usage), it's extremely helpful to debug by looking through the application traces. LangSmith gives clear visibility and debugging information at each step of an LLM sequence, making it much easier to identify and root-cause issues.\\n\\nYou can also create datasets, which are collections of inputs and reference outputs, and use these to run tests on your LLM applications. These test cases can be uploaded in bulk, created on the fly, or exported from application traces.
